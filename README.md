# FileSearcher

Search for a string in the file / s of the specified format.

Using this application, you can find the entered string in files of a given format. The search affects the entire specified path and the entire hierarchy of folders. File search is optimized for multithreading (used by Forkjoinpool). When files are found, a window appears where the paths to each file are indicated on the left, and the text of the file itself appears on the right, with the line highlighted in green.
