# FileSearcher

Search for a string in the file/s of the specified format.

Using this application, you can find the entered string in files of a given format. The search affects the entire specified path and the entire hierarchy of folders. File search is optimized for multithreading (used by Forkjoinpool). When files are found, a window appears where the paths to each file are indicated on the left, and the text of the file itself appears on the right, with the line highlighted in green.

When you run the program, you will see this frame.
